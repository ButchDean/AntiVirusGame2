AntiVirusGame2
==============

This was the game that I originally wrote in 2001 that helped me get into the games industry. Subsequent very minor updates were made to 2006 to make sure it still compiled and ran (hence the '2'). Not how I code professionally now, but I'm still very proud of this first effort. 

Note
----

You will need to build this out-the-box on an old Windows XP with Visual Studio 2005 or earlier setup. This project is so old now that it is not worth updating.
